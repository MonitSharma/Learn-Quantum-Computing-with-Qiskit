## Quantum States and Qubits

If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, you’re not alone. Our intuitions come from day-to-day experiences, and so are better at understanding the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or electrons. Though quantum objects can seem random and chaotic at first, they just follow a different set of rules. Once we know what those rules are, we can use them to create new and powerful technology. Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example of this.

This chapter introduces the computing concepts that we'll explore in later chapters, then introduces basic quantum concepts.

## Multiple Qubits and Entanglement

We've seen some interesting effects with isolated qubits and single qubit gates, but the true power of quantum computing comes from interactions between qubits. In this section we will introduce multiple qubit gates and explore the interesting behaviours of multi-qubit systems.

With the basics down, this chapter explores the consequences of these new quantum effects, and sets us up with tools to understand quantum algorithms.

## Quantum Protocols and Quantum Algorithms

So far, we've seen various quantum gates and operations, and we've explored some interesting properties of these gates. Each of these pages shows how we can combine quantum operations into a quantum algorithm that outperforms their classical counterpart. As a bonus, some of these algorithms are actually useful too!

![](https://qiskit.org/images/learn/course/quantum-protocols-and-quantum-algorithms/quantum-protocols-and-quantum-algorithms.png)

In this chapter, we use quantum effects to build powerful algorithms, starting from simple proof-of-concept algorithms, through to Shor's famous factoring algorithm (and beyond).
