 ## What is this book about?
 
 This book is a recipe-based guide for developers interested in programming quantum computers with IBM Quantum® Experience and Qiskit®. You'll learn all the concepts and components of Qiskit that you need for programming quantum computers, from visualizing circuits and gates with Qiskit Terra and simulating realistic noise profiles with Qiskit Aer, to delving into quantum algorithms with Aqua.

This book covers the following exciting features: Visualize a qubit in Python and understand the concept of superposition Install a local Qiskit simulator and connect to actual quantum hardware Compose quantum programs at the level of circuits using Qiskit® Terra Compare and contrast Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing (NISQ) and Universal Fault-Tolerant quantum computing using simulators and IBM Quantum® hardware Mitigate noise in quantum circuits and systems using Qiskit® Ignis Understand the difference between classical and quantum algorithms by implementing Grover’s algorithm in Qiskit®
